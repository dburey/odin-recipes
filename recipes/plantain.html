     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Fried plantains are a beloved Jamaican side dish that highlight the natural sweetness of the ripe fruit. The plantains are peeled, sliced—often on a diagonal for a larger surface area—and then fried until they develop a beautifully caramelized, golden-brown exterior. Beneath that crisp shell lies a soft and sweet interior, offering a gentle counterpoint to the savory flavors of jerk meats, stews, or other traditional Jamaican dishes. Whether served as a tasty accompaniment or enjoyed on their own, fried plantains lend a comforting sweetness to the table that completes any island-inspired meal.</p>
