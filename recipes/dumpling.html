    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jamaican fried dumplings, often referred to as “Johnny Cakes,” are a beloved staple in Jamaican cuisine. They are typically made from a simple mixture of flour, baking powder, salt, and a hint of sugar. Once combined, the dough is kneaded until smooth, formed into small rounds or flattened discs, and then fried to a golden crisp. The result is a tender, fluffy interior encased in a slightly crunchy exterior. Often enjoyed at breakfast alongside ackee and saltfish—or served as a side with savory stews—these bite-sized delights offer a warm, comforting taste of the island’s culinary traditions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into cubes and softened</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub in butter until the mixture is crumbly.</li>
        <li>Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form a firm dough; knead briefly.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Break off pieces of dough and shape them into biscuit-like patties.</li>
        <li>Place just enough of the dumplings into the hot oil so they are not crowded; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
    </ol>
