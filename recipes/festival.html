    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jamaican festival is a sweet, fried cornmeal dumpling that’s a beloved companion to jerk dishes and other savory island favorites. Made from a simple blend of flour, cornmeal, sugar, and baking powder, the dough is shaped into elongated, finger-like pieces before being fried to a golden hue. The result is a slightly crisp exterior giving way to a tender, subtly sweet interior, which beautifully complements the spicy, smoky flavors of jerk chicken or fish. It’s a comforting, must-try treat that captures the delightful fusion of textures and tastes in Jamaican cuisine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp all-spice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift in the self-raising flour, cornmeal, sugar and all-spice, mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add in the butter and incorporate until the consistency is grainy.</li>
        <li>In a cup, mix together the water and vanilla extract, begin adding it into the dry ingredients until the dough forms into a slightly sticky dough. Cover and let sit for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8-10 equal parts. Flour a surface and roll each dough in a cylindrical fashion until you have two pointed ends. Repeat this process for all the dough portions.</li>
        <li>Heat up your oil to 350℉ in a deep large pot or pan, begin to drop in the festivals, it is fine to fry in 2 batches so the oil is not overcrowded. Let it fry on medium to low heat on all sides until golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a sheet lined with paper towels to drain off any excess grease.</li>
    </ol>
